#What didn't work well
Knowing the best way of structuring the playwright tests. So should each test encapsulate a process or area?

Cannot give it a full data entry blade and have it automatically pick up any non-text related fields

Cannot seem to work out how to use the date picker control, we have to be specific about the actions needed.

Instead of telling it to fill in the whole form, be more specific about filling in each field, one at a time.

Struggled to select a dropdown list option
